## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Guido van Rossum created Python in the late 1980s, and it has since become one of the most popular programming languages worldwide. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

##What You Can Do with Python:

### Web Development:

Use frameworks like Django and Flask for building robust web applications.
Create dynamic websites, RESTful APIs, and server-side scripts.

### Automation and Scripting:

Write scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
Develop system administration scripts for managing servers and infrastructure.

### Desktop GUI Applications:

Create desktop applications using libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy.


## What You Cannot Do with Python:

### Mobile App Development:

While there are tools like Kivy and BeeWare, Python is not as commonly used for mobile app development as languages like Java (Android) or Swift (iOS).

### Browser-Side Development:

Python is not typically used for client-side web development; JavaScript is the dominant language for this purpose.

## How is Python different from JS


Python and JavaScript (JS) are both popular programming languages, but they serve different purposes and are commonly used in different areas of software development. Here are some key differences between Python and JavaScript:

### Use Cases:
#### Python:
Widely used for server-side web development (Django, Flask).
Popular in data science and machine learning (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow).
Used for automation, scripting, and backend development.
#### JavaScript:
Mainly used for front-end web development (React, Angular, Vue.js).
Also used for server-side development (Node.js) and mobile app development (React Native).


### Deployment:
#### Python:
Deployed on web servers for web applications.
Used in various environments, including cloud computing.
#### JavaScript:
Primarily used for client-side scripting in web browsers.
Server-side deployment through Node.js.
